What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the hidden meta data directory required to be able to do cimmits and track changes to files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area allows you more flexibility to decide which files to add,commit and make changes before the final decision.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only the files effected by the change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Could be creating a version that has major changes and is experimental like for example a MAC version for a windows game.
Branching would make sure that the main version does not get broken while experimenting wit the mac version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
you can see the path back to its parents and possible the main branch.
